                <h2>Outreach</h2>
                
                <h3>Public Engagement</h3>
                <p>One of the highlights of being an astronomer is getting to interact with the public. Astronomy offers a unique opportunity to connect with people who might otherwise be scared or put-off from science. Using a combination of hands-on observing and craft activities, we can show kids (of ALL) ages a little bit more about the universe and the principles of science.</p>
                
                <h3>Educational Activities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public observatory nights</li>
                    <li>School presentations</li>

                <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                <p>From 2022-2023, I served as event coordinator and then President of the University of Wisconsin - Madison Astronomy Club. I expanded the club's membership, quadrupling our active members from ~10 to more than 40, with more than 150 members who frequently attended observing nights. One of my priorities was developing the skills necessary to do outreach work in public schools. We trained ~15 students how to use telescopes and do space-related arts and crafts. We used these skills to start a range of outreach events, reaching more than 4,000 people in schools and in the public around Madison, WI. </p>
                
                <h3>Talks and Presentations</h3>
                <p>I have spoken publicly at many different places. Here is a small list:</p>
