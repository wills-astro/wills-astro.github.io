                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>Music is a key part of my life. Here, I'll share a couple songs that my bands ("Live from Mars," "Coy Fish") have released, as well as lyrics I wrote for them.</p>

                    <div class="poem-content">I was lost and all alone
                        Didn’t know how or why to carry that stone 
                        All I ever had felt lost in
                        Endless daily strains and huffs
                        
                        Look inside the photo album 
                        See a young boy staring back at me 
                        So hopeful in his eyes and yet 
                        They’re just a dreamful circus act 
                        
                        See into his eyes
                        From a vertical decline 
                        Grab the rope and swim on up
                        Break the surface, now look up
                        
                        Coming back to life
                        Bring me back to life 
                        From the long and dark embrace
                        We are coming back to life 
                        
                        ♫
                        
                        My belt’s too big, but my heart is full
                        Birds sings outside on a fountain throne 
                        Melodies flying on the wind
                        There’s no need for anything more
                        
                        Walk outside on a sunny day
                        Ten years behind, but never late
                        Sing this song so I will know 
                        Today’s the day I accelerate
                        
                        ♫
                        
                        Coming back to life
                        Bring me back to life
                        From the long and dark embrace
                        We are coming back to life
                        
                        Coming back to life
                        Bring me back to life
                        From the long and dark embrace
                        We are coming back to life</div>

                        Dreams slip back and fade away
                        Leaving worlds as but a taste
                        But in this moment to which I wake
                        Will I find these dreams some future day?
                        
                        Is it gone now?
                        What still
                        remains?
                        Feels like I’m only 
                        Half awake
                        
                        When first we met that September day 
                        A journey began we could not waste 
                        And now we go our separate ways
                        We found our dreams that cloudy day
                        
                        Is it gone now?
                        What still remains?
                        Feels like I’m only 
                        Half awake</div>
